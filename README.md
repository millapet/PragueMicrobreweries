# PragueMicrobreweries
A simple map of microbreweries in Prague made using Leaflet. 
Microbreweries' information was originally part of a school project at CTU in Prague, Faculty of Civil Engineering, 2016. Since then more breweries have been added, feel free to contact me if you know about any others!

A user location button has been added, click it to see which microbrewery is the nearest to you!
